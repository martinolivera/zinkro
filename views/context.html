    <h1>Zinkro Proposal: The Harmony Calendar</h1>
    <div class="quote">
      A new system to reconnect human time with natural and cosmic rhythms.
    </div>
    <h2>1. Context: Why a new calendar?</h2>
    <p>The Gregorian calendar, while functional, presents astronomical mismatches, irregularities (months of 28 to 31 days), and a growing disconnection from natural cycles. In addition, its origin is tied to specific traditions, not a global vision.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Better synchronizes with the real tropical year (~365.2422 days).</li>
      <li>Logical and predictable (months of equal length).</li>
      <li>Integrates both hemispheres and many cultures.</li>
      <li>Fosters a more conscious relationship with time.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>2. General Proposal: The Harmony Calendar</h2>
    <h3>Basic Structure:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>13 months of 28 days (always 4 exact weeks).</li>
      <li>Total: 364 days + 1-2 extra days outside the monthly cycle.</li>
      <li>Alignment with the March equinox as an astronomical reference point.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Advantages:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Perfect symmetry: Throughout the year, each month starts on the same day of the week (e.g., always Sunday).</li>
      <li>Simplified planning: Annual projections without adjustments for irregular months.</li>
      <li>Connection with nature: The new year coincides with the equinox (natural rebirth).</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>3. Key Components</h2>
    <h3>a) Days Out of Time</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 fixed day at the start (March equinox) + 1 additional leap day every certain cycle.</li>
      <li>Purpose: Act as global "resets" for reflection, celebration, and collective synchronization.</li>
      <li>Proposed names: <b>Portal</b> or <b>Synchrony</b>.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>b) Naming Systems (flexible)</h3>
    <p>Multiple options are proposed for naming the months, democratizing the symbology:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Numeric</b> (e.g., 1, 2, 3 or Unarius, Duarius... Terdecimus): Clarity and neutrality.</li>
      <li><b>Universal Natural</b> (e.g., Dawn, Sun, Wind, Rain... Moon): Connection with non-seasonal elements.</li>
      <li><b>Human Qualities</b> (e.g., Awareness, Courage, Empathy... Unity): Focus on personal development.</li>
      <li><b>Celtic, Mayan, other cultures</b>: Honoring ancestral wisdom.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>c) Leap Year Rule</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Option 1: Keeping the Gregorian cycle (every 4 years, except century years not divisible by 400).</li>
      <li>33-year cycle with 8 leap years (accuracy of 1 day error every ~4,464 years).</li>
      <li>Simple alternative: "Leap year every 5 years, except every 40 years".</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>4. Implementation and Transition</h2>
    <h3>Phase 1: Outreach and Education (2025-2026)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Development of digital tools: Zinkro app and web platform to visualize dates in both systems.</li>
      <li>Global campaign: Explanatory content on social networks, forums, and media.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Phase 2: Gradual Adoption</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Dual transition period: Parallel use of the Gregorian and new calendar.</li>
      <li>Proposed start event: March 21 (equinox) as Day Out of Time.</li>
      <li>Start year: Year 1, when its use begins. Another option is to add 10,000 to the current year as the Holocene or Human Era, so starting in 2026 would be year 12026 HE.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Phase 3: Normalization</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Adoption in global planning: States, companies, and communities use the new system for events and goals.</li>
      <li>Culture and traditions: New festivities aligned with natural cycles (e.g., Harvest Festival in the month of Maturation).</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>5. Invitation to the Global Community</h2>
    <div class="call">
      This calendar is an open invitation to co-create a more logical and meaningful temporal system.<br><br>
